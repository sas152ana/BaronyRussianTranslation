            "raw_text": "\t\r\n\tA Brief Survey of Goblins\r\n\t\r\n\tBy Horace P. Fetch\r\n\t\r\n\tSlovenly, pungent, beastly; These are adjectives that we humans commonly pair with the creatures we call goblins. Though fitting, they do possess a social structure that, though savage, is not unlike our own primitive history. They are capable of organizing and respecting a hierarchy, which they have largely used to organize against humans. There was a dark time when we could only cower as they destroyed our homes and kidnapped our children, but those days are forever over, for I, Horace P. Fetch, have spent years investigating goblins up close!\r\n\r\n\tDuring my investigation, on a particularly eventful evening, I had managed to narrowly steal away unnoticed. It was time to arm myself with a collection of weapons. I sought fine equipment from Harold's Armor & Arms, but he had been trapped and held hostage by the swamp fiends! It should be said, dear reader: his weapons are truly the best! But the only stock he had remaining was but a brittle bronze axe. It would have to do. The next time I was near to being discovered, I would hold my ground.\r\n\t\r\n\tWhen it became necessary, I was able to defeat the goblins by taking advantage of their physical shortcomings. Besides noting their laughable height, on average a full ten centimeters lower than myself, I observed dozens of unsophisticated duels between them. Some things became clear: They prefer to settle petty spats with swords and fists. Their tough hides tend to leave them bruised and bleeding from these attacks, but rarely in mortal danger before yielding to their physical superior and living to fight another time. For true grudges, they wield weapons they themselves fear.\r\n\t\r\n\tThe moment I was first discovered, I used this knowledge to my advantage. The scout who spotted me hailed flaming arrows upon me. Though my armor protected me from much of the arrows' bites, the flames engulfed my cloak. Thinking quickly, I rolled into the shallow water as he called for his allies, quenching the consuming blaze. Thinking me dead, I lurched from the filthy swamp and descended upon him with my axe, which shattered upon his thick, though yielding, skull.\r\n\t\r\n\t\"Good heavens,\" most good people would say, \"what about his incoming allies, Mr. Fetch?\" Well, dear reader, upon seizing the slain scout's shortbow I was able to pick off another spear-wielding warrior who came charging in. It is quite like this: although Goblins appear most frightful and strong in numbers, the truth of it is that they organize poorly. With the warrior's spear and shield in hand, I was able to easily deflect the blows of the remaining sword-wielding skirmishers, running them through with the iron spear, one after the other. The real scare came from a shaman, who by some cruel mystery, had fashioned means of magical assault with fire.\r\n\t\r\n\t\"But Mr. Fetch,\" you might be thinking, \"goblins are dull-witted brutes. How could they ever wield magic?\" Well that, dear reader, is an excellent question! In my observations, I have found them utterly illiterate. Certainly, the answer is that he must've stolen a red staff of fire from a poor unsuspecting human, cruelly slain while unawares! The incompetent brutes must rely on theft to mimic a human's might. While the goblin's fire did singe my brows, my fine enchanted cloak withstood the spell and roasted its sender.\r\n\t\r\n\tThat's all my tips, folks! I am sure if you study my words you will find yourself better suited to defending yourself from goblins in the future. Keep an eye out for my next, coming under the title: Wooing the Succubus! Until next time!\r\n\t\r\n\t-- Horace P. Fetch\r\n",

They call themselves the \"ZAP Brigade\" and wield mighty staffs of lightning. Well equipped, they appear to patrol throughout all depths of the Hamlet mines. They appear in small squads ranging in size from just a few individuals all the way up to nine. You'll know they're near when you hear the loud fanfare they regale themselves with whenever they descend into dangerous territory. I have not seen them carrying any instruments with them; the music they create must be of magical origin.\r\n\r\n\tWhile they seek to slay any monsters they discover, of particular note about the ZAP Brigade is that they pride themselves in hunting down and destroying wild minotaurs; an impressive feat to speak of for sure, but one that our agents cannot confirm. It is frankly very unclear to whom they hold their allegiances, if they hold allegiance to anyone at all; but they seem peaceful and cooperative, so no one has ever complained of their presence. That said, they seem unorganized, and easily distracted. While they carry trinkets that guard them from accidentally destroying one another, the intervention of a true leader might transform them into a truly threatening force.\r\n\r\n\tIt is my guess that they work with the wizard Merlin. Their reckless methods, penchant for drama, and fondness for lightning seem a clear connection to that oafish wizard. While it was wise to expel him from the guild many moons ago, following the disastrous experiment when he destroyed his own tower, this may indeed be concerning evidence of his continued meddling. However, Merlin and the ZAP Brigade are seen together so infrequently that this is little more than conjecture on my part.\r\n\r\n\tI hope this report is adequate for your strategic requirements.\r\n\tBezel P.\r\n\tGuildmaster\r\n",

            "raw_text": "To the Hunter's Guild and the pupils of Bram Kindly,\r\n\r\nIt was so much simpler before. When something died it stayed dead. One of the few facts of life I grew to rely on as I completed guild jobs. That fact has been challenged lately, and I've spent nearabouts a year prospecting the hills near Hamlet. Here, it's common to face an ambush by a ghoul or the skeleton of a long-dead soldier. With their prior death somehow undone, it's up to savvy hunters to redo it with courage and confidence.\r\n\r\nThese undead, though manageable for somebody of my profession, I still kill more than I'd like. As a result, I hoped to get to the bottom of the undead threats over the last year. In my findings thus far, I haven't been able to discern if they originate from Hamlet, but they do seem drawn here.\r\n\r\nWe've grown accustomed to breaking bones with a mace, or hacking apart rotten flesh with axes. But recently, at least since the Magician's Guild began researching the caves near Hamlet, more serious threats have emerged. These share similar characteristics of undeath with ones you're already familiar with.\r\nGiven their variety and power, I must advise carrying Holy Water to help defend yourself against them, especially if you seek them out as we are often tasked to do.\r\n\r\nYou may've heard kids' tales about blood-drinking dead men who can steal your life force and have all sorts of other powers. I regret to report that vampires aren't just a myth. While they are well-groomed and dapper dandies, they are bloodthirsty and cruel when hungry. Avoid them, or risk having your life stolen and used for their benefit.\r\n\r\nI have also to caution you against a kind of ghost that I've only seen emerge recently. I must assume that it is a cursed undead spirit. I escaped with my life, but I am certain it sought to possess my body. It stalked me invisibly through dark tunnels. When it appeared and attacked, it looked like me, but oily black.\r\nOur minds often play tricks on us as we see threats in the shadows. Now we must take that paranoia seriously.\r\n\r\nCarry with you silver arrows, as many as you can buy, for all the undead fear them.\r\nI regret that I don't have better news.

The so-called Baron Herx, formerly a wealthy but otherwise simple merchant lord, has now achieved repulsive powers, thanks to your negligence. As I warned, this is not a political squabble, it is a supernatural and existential threat to the realm.\r\n\r\nAgainst your moronic commands, I have embedded myself with the people of Hamlet here in these cursed mines. I find them enslaved and destitute, fighting for their survival against beasts and undead. The great underground city he had built here now falls into the hands of trolls and gnomes. Traps laid for these monsters kill as many citizens as they do their intended targets. It will be a ruin within the year.\r\n\r\nFor fear that the wisdom and legacy of these people will be lost forever, I have rallied as many heroes and humble folk alike as I can, to work together in solidarity against their corrupt master in secret. We have founded a library, a town, and a militia of merchants whom I have personally trained in magic. So far, this infrastructure remains a secret from the Baron, but for how long, I can't say. The economy and military I've helped construct here should help build a revolution against the corrupt ruler, no thanks to you. In all this, I still speak not against you publicly, as tales of the Magicians' Guild still inspire a deviant trickster to use his cleverness in heroism.\r\n\r\nBut I fear it won't be enough. As I sleep, I have nightmares of a fiery, nightmarish force, seeping through the cracks and tunnels of this place. In my mind's eye, I see it warming Herx's mattress. Its embers glisten in his cape. In his eyes. On his imposter crown. I urge you to earn the reputation these people hold of you and use your power for the good of the common folk.\r\n\r\nWith help from adventurers and miners here, I am gathering primordial powers that may help detach Herx from the devilish power he has sought here in these mines. Orbs that can collect and seal away extra-dimensional essences that have been wrongfully drawn into our mortal realm. \r\n\r\nDespite your consistent indifference and lack of wisdom, I implore you to take action. Help me dethrone Herx. Send agents, artifacts, and knowledge that will help destroy him. I am grateful that I am not relying on you solely. I cannot overstate the threat we are facing, not only in Herx, but in what empowers him.\r\n\r\nMy only fear is that the fruits of my labor will be somehow reversed and used against us.

Good! That's why I'm here! First off:\r\n\r\n\t1. Stay repleted! Thats right! A full tummy keeps you energized, which can be used to get stronger! A diet of rare meat, cheese, and booze will do the trick. Even a simple gulp of fresh water is better than an empty belly.\r\n\r\n\t2. Always be working! Never sleep. You know what sleeps? The creepy things at the bottom of the mine. And you don't wanna be those, because they're weak! Also, Herx'll raise your taxes if he finds you sleeping on the job. Dallying around will cause you to be hungry. And you know what hunger can do to you, don't you? Of course you do! We just went over how important a full stomach is!\r\n\r\n\t2b.

If the last pile of rocks was too easy for you, chances are your time would be better spent looking for the BIGGEST job and doing that instead! A mighty body is too strong for regular work. You need to go out and find the hardest task you can find if you're really going to get as strong as I expect you to be.\r\n\r\n\t5. Work smarter... AND harder! Ever rummage up some new tools and have no idea how they work? A strong worker never lets an opportunity pass them by. Mess around with new junk until you have it figured out. You'll work different muscles, and that just means that more types of your muscles will be strong. Why, every last one of my muscles is maximized to the fullest. Even my brain muscle!\r\n\r\n\tWell, there you have it! A quick guide to being efficient, strong, and a good and loyal worker! Remember, don't slack off!

Past the water table, sands, and ancient ruins that were uncovered by a previous generation of Hamlet's descendants. Each account of these rumors had some things in common: First, the creature appears in the shape of a man, twisted like a corpse, and capable of unearthly magic. The second, ever more worrying, the creature is formerly the ruler of Hamlet. \r\n\r\n\tBaron Herx, who ruled Hamlet tyrannically. The one who was punished to an eternity in the mines in the miners' great revolt. Upon my arrival to Hamlet, a talk with the locals suggests everyone senses the presence of a Lich. \"I was there the day we locked him way down there,\" reported the very elderly local. \"No wholesome thing could survive down there. It could only be Herx. It must be.\"\r\n\r\n\tA recent account confirms this theory. I got to meet the one person who claims to have seen the Lich and lived to tell the tale. After I bought him a drink, he was willing to share his story. \"He were a tall creature, and his flesh were dark. Proper dark. He had grotesque yellow teeth, and eyes that pierced me spirit. He swam through the air effortlessly, and at a speed I'd not seen ever before in me life. But I could tell it was Herx by his crown, and his cape,\" ornaments befitting the ruler of a wealthy barony. \"And then I recognized his face.\"\r\n\r\n\t\"He released volleys of magic that lit up the dark chamber, cackling all the while.

If yur an intruder, git out before I suggest you git goin' before I git to ya. If not, I'mma teach you to do what I couldn't: Survive! So, you gots to know yur enemies! Let's start with the weakest, and head up on to the meanest!\r\n\r\n\r\nRats: Rats ain't too much of a threat, that is, if you're prepared. But I seen many a poor adventurer take grievous wounds from the likes of rats while dallyin' about with their belongins. If you see'm comin' just a hit or two from yer weapon'll put 'em in their place. Ya might find some old cheese stashed away in their cheeks, but their fresh meat I find far more palatable. And you'll be needing some food if you plan on surviving the mines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSkeletons: Rattlin' bones didn't always used to skettle through the mines in the early days. But some time after I set up my shop, they started comin' round. Geared up like Herx's old goons, they're not to be trifled with. Pay attention to their kit! An armored skeleton is a tougher target, as you might surmise. Still, bones and old cursed iron ain't no match for a strong arm with a sturdy stick or mace. Get the jump on'em, or practice yer blockin', and you'll be fine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSlimes: I'd just as soon leave these thangs alone. They're stupid, and will just attack ya cuz yur in their way. They're tougher than they look, but slower'n snail snot. And they look just like that too when they ooze their acidic form out of a water pump. Unless you kill them, they just go wanderin' about forever because they don't need food or nothin' like that. So it might be for the best just to avoid'em.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpiders: These big, nasty critters are a plague! They'll run at ya fast-like, and are always hungry. A fool might think they're sleepin', but they're just patiently waiting for their next meal, and they'll try to make a meal outta darn near everything. My tactic is to hit them til they die, and it usually works. So try that! But a spider bite may oft be soaked in venom. Some cures or a shield will make sure they don't outlast you in the mines, if you can't slay'em fast.\r\n\r\n\r\nGnomes: Why these buggers are a right shame, they are. I first saw'em all dolled up in their cute little outfits and little hats, they just looked like the friendliest folk I ever met. But don't be fooled, they're a greedy sort and will try to put ya down just at the sight of ya. As I extended my hand in friendship, one blasted me with lightning till my mustache hairs stood on end, and we went our separate ways. They don't really have much armour, so keep that in mind. You might want a bow or fireballs o somn' to take care of these little pests, least if you see one with a forky yeller stick.\r\n\r\n\r\nWell thems just about all the beasties I seen down here.

But what can I tell you about him that you haven't heard from the ghastly stories we've been told about Hamlet? What if I told you it doesn't all start in Hamlet? Indeed Herx, the man, did exist for a time prior to his governance of the cursed town.\r\n\r\n\tThrough blood, luck, or money, Herx gained influence among the nobles. Eventually, the president and his cabinet became indebted to Herx. The recompense? Hamlet. While Hamlet had been prospering magnificently, news of the wealthy and influential Baron taking over as mayor struck the citizens with hope. Hamlet was a productive mining town with flourishing industries and trade of every kind (at the time, of course). \r\n\t\r\n\tTheir love of the Baron lasted at least until his arrival.\r\n\r\n\tOffering consummate wealth if successful, Herx commissioned the people of Hamlet with an ambitious dig. Seeking ancient gold, all the working folk of Hamlet abandoned their trades, while Herx's company provided logistical necessities. Within weeks, the Hamlet economy dwindled. While the citizens were merry hard workers for a time, each new depth broken brought with it a new layer of hopelessness. Herx's goods exploded in cost, and the citizens' wages accreted taxes, as the Baron's services compensated for Hamlet's dying industry.\r\n\r\n\tIn practice, his policy overworked and taxed the people into poverty with unprecedented rapidity. Survivors reported the Baron's grin growing more widely with each new stage of suffering. Eventually, they were working just to survive, and in debt. His merchant army wouldn't allow them to leave without repaying their debt in taxes.\r\n\r\n\tThe citizens reported the growing hatred they held for their new master:\r\n\t\"He can't be human, no human could possibly be this evil. Lords above help us if so.\"\r\n\tThey had nowhere to go.\r\n\r\n\tThey mined (literally) all day and night for a master who demanded gold in a mine that only produced copper, zinc, tin, and coal. Piles of unprocessed ore choked the town streets, interested parties long since satisfied with warehouses filled with the excess. The people came up with a plan:\r\n\r\n\tThey would tell Herx they struck gold at the bottom floor of the mine.\r\n\tUpon his arrival, they would barricade him in, and lock up the minehead. \r\n\tThey would then leave him to die there and the people of Hamlet would take their city back. \r\n\r\n\tThe plan worked, but not forever.\r\n\r\n\tNobody knows exactly what happened to Baron Herx down in the mines. However, his will haunts any who dare step foot nearby. His vengeful hatred lives on. The church claims that an incubated evil will awaken the forces of Hell itself, and the Hunter's Guild believes this to be the origin of the undead monster known as a Lich. With that power, Herx summoned an army of darkness to seize upon Hamlet, and annihilate its citizens. If the Hunter's Guild is to be believed, he has formidable magic at his disposal, and the denizens of Hell itself may be at his beckon.\r\n\r\n\tThe Baron no longer needed to escape the mines. Risk-seeking adventurers and lost humans wander their way into his lair, where he perhaps feasts on their flesh. Evidence shows there are still humans who are descendants of the survivors of the Hamlet incident who have set up civilization in the mines. They carry a revolutionary spirit, but must know things will never be the same. With hope, one day I will be able to append this book with their legacy.\r\n",

            "raw_text": "The Meaning of the Labyrinth\r\nRobert J. Betholew\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Labyrinth is an area of complex traps, dungeons, and mystery. Many a rumour and myth (such as the very famous \"Runners of the Maze\") come from this area of the underground. But why was it made? Who made it?\r\n\r\nThe oldest known reference to it is in the writings of an ancient Xaz'Cetian. The text, when translated, reads that the maze was invented to make it impossible for outsiders to get in so they can preserve the civilization and their way of life. Sections of the writing describe survival techniques in the maze, such as seeking out large rooms to avoid being lost in the small, often endlessly wandering smaller pathways.\r\n\t\r\nHowever, it is safe to say these writings are likely a more modern myth or a folk story, and that they have done more harm than good. Knowledge of the Xaz'Cetians existence wasn't even known of until 50 years after the imperialistic age. This doesn't qualify their potential awareness of imperial humans, however. Either way, prior to their disappearance, the Xaz'Cetians were likely more advanced than we think. Perhaps even more advanced than us.\r\n\r\nThis writing also implied that most Xaz'Cetians were comfortable with the patterns of the maze, and could navigate it easily to find food, using magic to map it. Other magic could aid in sensing the locations of food or foes. In theory, they could even be alive today, cleverly avoiding contact. But they did keep some record of their fears. Gruesome scenes depicted in surfaced Labyrinth reliefs show man-like beings being hacked apart by axes and spears, the blades slipping through their rigid, winged armor. \r\n\r\nMost believe these ancient people have been wiped out. Arcanists seem to believe that the Xaz'Cetians have set up a controlled, artificial climate perfect for their needs, though nobody can get them to explain why they believe this. Whatever the case, the maze and the fate of the Xaz'Cetians is a bit of a Zochgrinjers Dog deal. No one knows if it's dead or alive. And likely no one ever will, as there is no record of an explorer escaping the maze once entered.\r\n\r\nThe walls shift and change every day, and are filled with monsters. One may discover devious and deadly puzzles which tempt adventurers with costly treasure, while they starve to death trying to find a solution. No one knows what is at the end of the maze. Is there an ancient city in there, blocked from the rest of the world? Or just more maze, more temptation, and more death?\r\n\r\nThe potential meaning of the Labyrinth is argued all the time, but there will likely never be a truly sound answer.\r\n",

            "raw_text": "\r\n\tThe Pirate King\r\n\tby Fred\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\tThis is a true tale of how the current king of the isles, the Sea Baron, took the throne of Mal Dora for himself.\r\n\r\n\tIt all began many years ago -- not many remember these times. During the reign of the old pirate king, there sailed the seas a fierce pirate whom everybody took to calling Neckbeard, due to the terrifying visage of said facial hair! Indeed, he was infamous and powerful in his own right, but not so much as the grandson of Blackbeard -- Diablobeard. Many have heard the tales of Blackbeard, plunderer of the world's mighty empires, but nobody ever mentions Blackbeard's grandson. So great was his wickedness, that his very name was struck from the records! Aye, not even fit for legends are the most evil of men.\r\n\r\n\tIt was during the time of Diablobeard that Neckbeard fell in love with Princess Eleena, daughter of the late king. She was a fine lass -- most beautiful in the kingdom, they said. But alas, Neckbeard was just a lowly pirate captain, not fit for courting royalty. Only a noble, indeed, from the household of one of the 13 pirate lords had the privilege to the princess's hand. There was, however, a way. The slimmest chance to attain his desires. Yes, for you see, Diablobeard was pillaging and razing every coastal city and fortress of Mal Dora. If he kept it up much longer, there would not be a single living person on this fair continent! Somebody had to stop him, and not all of the king's fleet and his best pirate captains could challenge Diablobeard. His formidability was attributed to the ungodly powers granted him by his ancient artifacts, rumored to have been collected off the very floor of the sea. Then as Diablobeard finished razing the greatest port and city on our continent, he set his eyes on the king's great floating palace.\r\n\r\n\tThrough the king's fleet he sailed as if through paper, nobody could even slow him down! Captain Neckbeard, seeing an opportunity, set out to confront the evil pirate Diablobeard. After a fierce battle lasting nearly a tenday, Diablobeard was struck down and Neckbeard scuttled his entire fleet! Then Neckbeard returned to the palace, with all of Diablobeard's treasures and plunder. The king granted Neckbeard his daughter's hand, and he took her to dine on her balcony. Among the many delicacies he presented from Diablobeard's ship, he took out a priceless jade chalice, unlike any other chalice eyes have ever been set upon. A sweet scent wafted up from the chalice -- from mere water! It enticed the young girl's tastebuds and begged her to ask for a sip of that clear liquid. Neckbeard said to her, it was Aqua Vitae, which he had found aboard Diablobeard's ship. That is, water from the fountain of youth! The princess drank from the cup and Neckbeard took her to bed. Later that night, the princess began dying. It was then, Neckbeard revealed to her that he had actually given her Aqua Mortis -- water of death -- and had drunk all of the water from the fountain of youth for himself! Then as she breathed her last, Neckbeard stormed the king's castle, slew him, and took the throne for his own. For the last century, he has ruled us as our king, the Sea Baron.\r\n\r\n\tBut that is not the end of the story, oh no. Unbeknownst to Neckbeard, and fortunately for the princess, what Neckbeard had actually discovered and given her was Aqua Somnis. The princess is not dead, but asleep, and to this day, she sleeps away in the bowels of the king's palace, waiting for the kiss of true love to set her free.\r\n\r\n",
